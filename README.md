# Netflix clone

(Still in proggress!)

Hello, I present to you my **Netflix clone** project. I was thinking about creating a project that will bring together front-end, working with api and a little bit of back-end code mixed with each other. The project is created in NextJS using a small amount of React Redux, Firebase and written in Typescript.
The page is fully responsive, cloning netflix site as accurate as possible (without their videos, icons, animations and not pixel perfect, but as close as possible).

## 📫 Project contains

- main pages for guest and for log in user,
- full registration netflix process (choosing devices, languages, series),
- user is available to log in, sign in and register,
- when user is log in different options are available (profile edit),
- unit tests (will come soon),
- 404 page (will come soon),
- accessibility practices,
- fully responsive,
- using firebase to log in / log out and auth management,
- using LocalStorage to store some auth data (no data is collected in this demo).

## 🛠 Used tools / programming languages / technologies

- HTML / CSS,
- NextJS (React Redux),
- Typescript,
- Firebase,
- Local Storage,
- Git / Github,
- Testing (Jest)

## 👩‍💻 TODO

- [ add profile edit sites ].
- [ add main log in site for adults and kids ],
- [ add testing ].
