# Netflix clone

Hello, I present to you my **Netflix clone** project. I was thinking about creating a project that will bring together front-end, working with api and a little bit of database knowledge / a bit of back-end code mixed with each other. The project is created in NextJS using a small amount of React Redux, Firebase, MongoDB and written in Typescript.
The page is fully responsive, cloning netflix site as accurate as possible (without their videos, animations etc.).

## 📫 Project contains

- pages when user is not log in - can't watch series etc.,
- 404 page,
- user is available to log in or sign in,
- when user is log in different options are available,
- unit tests,
- accessibility practices,
- using firebase to log in / log out and auth management,
- using MongoDB to store some database information,
- using LocalStorage to store some auth data,
- using dummy data in database.

## 🛠 Used tools / programming languages / technologies

- HTML / CSS,
- NextJS (React Redux),
- Typescript,
- Firebase,
- MongoDB,
- Local Storage,
- Git / Github,
- Testing (Jest)
