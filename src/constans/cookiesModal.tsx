        Netflix adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) and the
        European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA).
        You who opt-out of advertising cookies may continue to be presented with Netflix ads, but they
        will not be personalized by Netflix or our service providers. In addition, Netflix will continue
        to personalize your use of the site with cookies that you have consented to.
        In most browsers, you can also configure your privacy settings to prevent the acceptance of new
        cookies, receive notifications when a new cookie is received, or disable cookies altogether. If
        the browser is set to reject all cookies, the User will not receive behavioral advertising, but
        this may adversely affect the use of Netflix or prevent it altogether. In addition, if the User
        has used Netflix's cookie management tool to opt out of certain cookies, such settings will be
        remembered in a cookie stored on the User's device. Therefore, in order for the User's
        preferences to be saved, it is important that the User's browser configuration allows the use of
        cookies. If the User deletes or clears cookies or changes his browser, he must reconfigure his
        cookie settings.
        For more information on Netflix's use of cookies, please see the Cookies and Online Advertising
        section of the Privacy Policy.

        click-through rates, etc.) about our users' use of Netflix, so that we can improve and customize
        our website and service and perform market analysis. If such cookies are deleted, it may result

        Such cookies use information about your use of this site or app and other sites and apps, and
        about your response to our ads and emails. They are used to deliver ads in which the user may be
        interested and for analytics and optimization purposes. These types of ads are called
        "interest-based ads" and are displayed to users outside the Netflix domain. Netflix uses legal
        and technical solutions to prevent advertising partners from accessing information about the
        specific titles you select, the URLs you visit, and the material you watch on our service. We do
        not share information about the titles you select or the materials you view on our site.
